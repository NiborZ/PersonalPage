**Raft** is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand and is used for managing a replicated log. It ensures that multiple replicas of distributed systems agree on shared state in a fault-tolerant way. Raft is used in systems where consistency and reliability are critical, despite the possibility of node failures and network interruptions.

### Key Concepts of Raft:

**Consensus**: Raft enables distributed systems to maintain a consistent state across all nodes by managing a replicated log. It is used primarily for systems that require data to be the same across all nodes, such as databases and distributed configuration systems.

**Terms and Elections**: Raft divides time into terms of arbitrary length, and each term begins with an election where one of the nodes becomes the leader. The leader stays in charge until it fails or a term ends, and a new leader is elected. This leader handles all client interactions and log replication.

**Leader Election**: If a follower does not hear from a leader for a certain amount of time, it assumes there is no active leader and initiates an election to choose a new leader. This involves followers incrementing their term and voting for a candidate, including potentially themselves.

**Log Replication**: Once elected, the leader begins to process client requests, which involve appending entries to the replicated log. The leader then replicates these entries to the follower nodes. For an entry to be committed and applied to the state machine, it must be safely replicated to the majority (more than half) of the nodes.

**Safety**: Raft ensures that the replicated log remains consistent across all nodes, even in cases of network failures or delays. This includes complex mechanisms to handle inconsistencies and ensure that followers' logs eventually match the leader's log.

**Fault Tolerance**: Raft can tolerate up to `(N-1)/2` failures, where `N` is the number of nodes in the cluster. This means that as long as a majority of the nodes are functioning, the cluster can continue to operate correctly.

### How Raft Works:

- **Election**: When a node starts, it begins as a follower. If it receives no communication from a leader, it becomes a candidate and starts an election, voting for itself and requesting votes from other nodes.
- **Log Replication**: Once a leader is chosen, it accepts log entries from clients and replicates these to its followers. It also sends periodic heartbeats to maintain authority and prevent new elections.
- **Safety and Commitment**: A log entry is considered committed when it is stored on a majority of nodes. Only committed entries are applied to the state machine.

### Practical Usage:

Raft is employed in several prominent distributed systems:
- **etcd**: A key-value store widely used in the Kubernetes ecosystem for storing and managing the cluster's state.
- **Consul**: A service mesh solution using Raft for service discovery and configuration.
- **RethinkDB and CockroachDB**: Distributed databases that use Raft to synchronize data across replicas.
